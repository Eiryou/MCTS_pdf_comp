NEO PDF AI-Optimizer - Technical Notes (Short)

This project frames PDF compression as a constrained global optimization problem.

Core pipeline:
- Metadata stripping (pikepdf)
- Image recompression (PdfImage -> PIL -> JPEG/Flate) with safety guards
- Safe Flate recompression for simple Flate streams
- Structural save optimizations (object streams, compress_streams)

Search:
- Domain-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Real execution rollouts (no simulation)
- Multi-objective scoring with asymmetric penalties

See TECHNICAL_NOTES_EXTENDED.txt for a longer description.
