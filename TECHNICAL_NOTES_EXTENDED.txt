NEO PDF AI-Optimizer - Technical Notes (Extended)

This repository accompanies a research-style implementation of:
"AI-guided PDF Structural Compression via Domain-Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search"

1) Problem Framing
PDF compression is treated as an optimization problem over a structured document space:
- objective: minimize output size
- constraints: preserve readability/compatibility (soft constraints with penalties)
- actions: parameter changes + pipeline mode switches

2) Why MCTS (instead of grid/random)
The search space is discrete and highly non-linear. Many combinations fail silently or degrade quality abruptly.
MCTS provides:
- exploration/exploitation balance
- reuse of partial search knowledge via backpropagated scores
- graceful anytime behavior (best-so-far always available)

3) Domain Constraints
Actions are constrained based on document profile and color detection:
- avoid grayscale conversion when original contains color
- avoid downsampling for text-like images
- enforce lower bounds on quality for mixed/image profiles
These reduce catastrophic outcomes and stabilize rollout results.

4) Evaluation Function (multi-objective, asymmetric)
Score combines:
- reduction ratio (progress toward soft target)
- visual similarity proxy (MSE-based SSIM-like estimate on sampled images)
- color preservation penalty
- zoom robustness coefficient (downsample/sharpness/mse mix)
Asymmetry: strong penalties for catastrophic color loss on color documents.

5) GS-Emulation
Ghostscript is not executed. "engine=gs" maps to:
- preset -> JPEG quality, subsampling, dpi-like targets, colorspace strategy
implemented with pikepdf + Pillow only.

6) Security/Hardening for public demo
- upload size cap
- page count cap
- concurrency semaphore
- rate limit per client
- cache isolation per Streamlit session + TTL

Disclaimer:
This is research/experimental software. Always verify outputs.
