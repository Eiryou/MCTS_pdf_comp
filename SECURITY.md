# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security issue, please open a GitHub Issue and label it **security**.
If the issue may expose sensitive user documents, please avoid posting real PDFs and instead provide a minimal reproduction.

## Operational Safety Notes
- PDFs may contain sensitive information. Avoid uploading confidential documents to public deployments.
- The app enforces basic upload-size, page-count, rate-limit, and concurrency guards, but they are not a substitute for a hardened production environment.
